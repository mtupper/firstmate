# Firstmate portable test shards

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns portable lane composition and execution.
`bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh` owns the proven-isolated candidate set.

## Verification inputs

The current candidate timings came from the 2026-07-29 concurrent proof recorded in [fm-test-isolation-proof.md](fm-test-isolation-proof.md).
The proof ran 24 candidates with four workers and no failures.

## Parallel lanes

The two parallel lanes use longest-processing-time assignment from those measured durations.

| Lane | Script count | Estimated duration |
|---|---:|---:|
| `portable-parallel-1` | 11 | 162436 ms (~162.4 s) |
| `portable-parallel-2` | 13 | 162754 ms (~162.8 s) |
| imbalance | | 318 ms |

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` contains the exact ordered memberships in `list_portable_parallel_1` and `list_portable_parallel_2`.

## Portable serial remainder

`portable-serial` includes every `tests/*.test.sh` that is neither proven-isolated nor `real-herdr-gated`.
It keeps watcher, lock, AFK, real tmux, daemon, secondmate lifecycle, bootstrap, live-harness opt-in, GUI-backend, and other unproven work serial.
Membership is derived rather than enumerated, so a newly added test lands here by default.

## Portable serial CI shards

On green CI run [30725985757](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/30725985757), that remainder accumulated 19m04s of script time against a 20-minute job timeout.
On [PR 1495](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/pull/1495), its main step ran about 19m51s before the job was cancelled at that boundary.
`portable-serial-<k>of<n>` splits it across `n` separate CI runners.
Each shard is still strictly serial in itself, and separate runners mean no two of these stateful scripts ever share a machine, so the split needs no concurrency isolation proof.

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns `n` and refuses any lane whose `of<n>` disagrees with it.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` derives the same `n` from `strategy.job-total` rather than a literal, so changing the shard count in either file without the other fails the lane loudly instead of leaving part of the required suite unrun.

Assignment is longest-processing-time bin packing over per-script duration hints embedded in `bin/fm-test-run.sh`.
The hints came from the `fm-test-timing-portable-serial-*` artifacts of green run [32430422568](https://github.com/mtupper/firstmate/actions/runs/32430422568) on 2026-08-20, where the lane ran 113 scripts in 2591454 ms of serial work.
A script with no hint gets the conservative `PORTABLE_SERIAL_DEFAULT_WEIGHT_MS` default.
Hints only affect balance: the coverage guard keeps the partition complete and disjoint whatever they say, so a stale hint costs a slower shard rather than lost coverage.

Staleness is not free, though, and it is the failure worth watching for.
The previous table below claimed four shards of about 286 s each while the lane had grown to 113 scripts, 42 of them unweighted and packed on the default.
Real shard times had drifted to between 508 s and 847 s of script work against a 900 s job bound, so the heaviest shard was one ordinary run of variance away from being cancelled, and a five-second test addition was enough to tip it.
Refresh the hints whenever a shard's measured time approaches its bound, not only when the table is obviously wrong.

| Lane | Script count | Estimated duration |
|---|---:|---:|
| `portable-serial-1of4` | 28 | 647870 ms (~647.9 s) |
| `portable-serial-2of4` | 27 | 647859 ms (~647.9 s) |
| `portable-serial-3of4` | 30 | 647865 ms (~647.9 s) |
| `portable-serial-4of4` | 28 | 647860 ms (~647.9 s) |
| imbalance | | 11 ms |

The single longest script, `tests/fm-remote-secondmate-lifecycle-e2e.test.sh` at 201360 ms, is the floor for any shard count.

Refresh the hints by downloading the per-shard timing artifacts from a green CI run, replacing the `portable_serial_weight_hints` table in `bin/fm-test-run.sh` with the measured `path`/`duration_ms` pairs, and updating the table above:

```sh
gh run download <run-id> --pattern 'fm-test-timing-portable-serial-*' -D /tmp/fm-serial
jq -r '.scripts[] | [.path, .duration_ms] | @tsv' /tmp/fm-serial/*.json | LC_ALL=C sort
bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage
```

## Coverage guard

`bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage` verifies that both parallel lanes partition the proven-isolated set.
It also verifies that the parallel lanes, portable serial lane, and real-Herdr family are disjoint and cover every `tests/*.test.sh` script.
It separately verifies that the portable serial CI shards are non-empty, disjoint, and together equal the portable serial lane.

## Timing artifacts

Portable shards, each portable serial shard, and the Herdr lane upload runner-generated timing JSON.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --aggregate-json` creates the combined summary artifact.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the exact artifact names and aggregation wiring.

## Local entry points

[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns the local test policy and common entry points.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --help` owns exact lane names, selection flags, and bounded `--jobs` mechanics.

## Timeouts

| Lane | Bound | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| portable parallel 1/2 | job `timeout-minutes: 10` | The measured shard sums are about three minutes and the timeout is a hang tripwire. |
| portable serial 1-4 | job `timeout-minutes: 15` | Each balanced shard is about eleven minutes of script work plus a few seconds of setup, so the bound stays a hang tripwire rather than a healthy-run ceiling. Balance depends on current hints; see the staleness note above. |
| Herdr | family-run step `timeout-minutes: 20`; job `timeout-minutes: 75` backstop | Healthy runs finish around 7 minutes, so the step bound is the hang tripwire (cleanup and timing artifacts still upload) while the job cap stays a last-resort backstop. |

Timeouts are hang tripwires rather than expected healthy durations.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the exact numbers.
